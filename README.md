# Rice Plant Watering using Decision Tree

Introduction :
Maintaining optimal soil moisture levels for rice plants is crucial for their growth and yield. This project utilizes a machine learning approach, specifically a Decision Tree classifier, to predict and classify the watering status of rice plants based on key environmental attributes such as soil moisture, temperature, humidity, and time. By automating this process, we aim to assist farmers and agricultural enthusiasts in ensuring the well-being of rice crops.

Project Goals:
- Train a Decision Tree classifier to predict the watering status of rice plants.
- Evaluate the model's performance in terms of accuracy and reliability.
- Provide a user-friendly interface for real-time predictions or batch processing.
